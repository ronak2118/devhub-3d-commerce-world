# 3D Models Placeholder

This directory is a placeholder for 3D models that would be used in the application. In a production environment, this would contain actual 3D model files in formats like GLB, GLTF, or OBJ.

For demonstration purposes, the application currently renders simple placeholder 3D cubes when a model is requested but not found. This simulates the 3D product viewing experience without requiring actual 3D assets.

## Expected Models:

- `/models/smart-hub.glb` - For the DevHub Smart Home Controller
- `/models/sensor-pack.glb` - For the Environmental Sensor Pack
- `/models/smart-lock.glb` - For the Secure Smart Lock Pro
- `/models/camera.glb` - For the 360Â° Security Camera
- `/models/gateway.glb` - For the DevHub Network Gateway
- `/models/smart-plug.glb` - For the Smart Power Outlet Pack

In a real implementation, these would be replaced with actual 3D models created by 3D artists or captured through 3D scanning processes.
